## Update on October 27, 2019

We started our machine learning and data science journey about two months ago.
So far, our focus has been python programming language and understanding grammars.
There are much more than we have covered. But I endeavored to teach you survival skills: 
How to find help and where to turn to when you get stuck. 
Moreover, I wanted all of us to think like a computer scientist.
We've been practicing, basic arithmetic operations, functions, loops, modules, and classes.
Checking data type has been emphasized. 
Clear understanding of containers like list, tuple, dictionary, and numpy array is critical.
We reached a milestone and now we set out to another phase of the journey, which will be more exciting.
