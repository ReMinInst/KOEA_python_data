# KOEA

This repository is for the KOEA python and data science study group, which meets for an hour every Saturday.
This group consists of engineers and scientists working in oil and gas industry. They are domain knowledge specialists with keen interests in Machine learning approaches to solve their problems in Geoscience. We watch online lectures and practice python programming and data science skills through examples, projects, and group discussions.

Before meetings, group members do
* read one or two chapters in our python programming textbook
* watch online lectures on EDX and/or Coursera on their own
* understand and practice previous session's examples

Our python programming materials are
* https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/
* https://www.learnpython.org/

Textbooks for machine learning are
* Hands-on machine learning with Scikit-learn, Keras & Tensorflow by Aurélien Géron
* Natural language processing with PyTorch by Delip Rao
* Generateive Deep learning by David Foster

We are following pytorch tutorials in 
* https://pytorch.org/tutorials/

For keras, please refer to
* https://keras.io/

Pytorch examples are
