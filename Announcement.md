## Update on January 18, 2020
Our study group resumed our meetings on January 4, 2020. 
We decided to add pytorch into our tool sets for machine learning projects.

In this year, our meeting time alternates between Saturday morning and Thursday evening.
For example, next week we meet on Thursday (January 23, 2020) from 7:30 PM to 9 PM.
In the follwoing week, we meet on Saturday (February 1, 2020) from 8 AM to 10 AM. 

Please find study material and learning resources at resources.md.
This will be udpated as we make progress and as needed.


## Update on October 27, 2019
We started our machine learning and data science journey about two months ago.
So far, our focus has been python programming language and understanding grammars.
There are much more than we have covered. But I've endeavored to share basic survival skills: 
how to find help and where to turn to when you get stuck. 
Personally, I have been training myself to think like a computer scientist.
In our meetings, we've been practicing basic arithmetic operations, functions, loops, modules, and classes.
Recently, we tried numpy array slicing, reshaping, and plotting. 
In all our meetings, data type has been emphasized. 
Clear understanding of containers like list, tuple, dictionary, and numpy array will be critical in any programming job.
Now, it seems that we reached a milestone. From this week, we set out to next phase of our journey, which will be more exciting.
