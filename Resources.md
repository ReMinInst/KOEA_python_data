# KOEA

This repository is for the KOEA python and data science study group, which meets for an hour every Saturday.
This group consists of engineers and scientists working in oil and gas industry. They are domain knowledge specialists with keen interests in Machine learning approaches to solve their problems in Geoscience. We watch online lectures and practice python programming and data science skills through examples, projects, and group discussions.

Before meetings, group members do
* read one or two chapters in our python programming textbook
* watch online lectures on EDX and/or Coursera on their own
* understand and practice previous session's examples

Our python programming textbook is 
* https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/

Textbooks for machine learning are
* Hands-on machine learning with Scikit-learn, Keras & Tensorflow 
* Natural language processing with PyTorch by Delip Rao
* Generateive Deep learning by David Foster
* Practical time series analysis by Aileen Nielsen

We are following pytorch tutorials in 
* https://pytorch.org/tutorials/

For keras, we refer to
* https://keras.io/

Pytorch examples are 
* https://github.com/pytorch/examples/

During our meetings, we do
* go through examples
* have discussions with other members and a session leader

So far, we have covered
* Week 1-4, python programming
* Week 05, plotting using matplotlib library
* Week 06, Git,Tensorflow, scikit-learn, and Pytorch installation
* Week 07, Keras image classification
* Week 08, Keras autoencoder
* Week 09, Keras regression
* Week 10, Pytorch regression
* Week 11, Pytorch image classification

When you join in our meetings, please feel free to start with any material you can learn comfortably.
If you get stuck and can not move on, you can always go back to one week back.

If you want to join in our meetings, please contact the current coordinator, mantophs@gmail.com.
Our meetings are in the Memorial City Mall area.
Thanks for your interest and participation.

Happy Learning!
