## Big thanks

I do not know how to express my tremendous gratitude toward the KOEA python study group.
Every meeting was great. In every meeting, 
it is confirmed that the best way to learn is to share/teach.
It was my honor and great joy to meet and talk with this group of wonderful people, engineers and scientists.
The stimulating questions have led all of us, especially myself, to deep thinking and discussions.
Thank you for participations with dedication and determination. I want to thank your family members for
letting you come on Saturday morning.
