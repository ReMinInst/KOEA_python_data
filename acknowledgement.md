## big thanks

I donot know how to express my tremendous gratitude toward the KOEA python study group.
Once again, it is confirmed that the best way to learn is to share/teach.
It was my honor and great joy to meet and talk with this group of wonderful people, engineers, and scientists.
The stimulating questions have led all of us, especially myself, to deep thinking and discussions.
Thank you for participations with interests and determination on Saturdays.
